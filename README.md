# Teeth Classification
# Overview
Classify dental images into disease categories using CNNs and Deep Learning models like MobileNet V2. 
The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and accurately categorize various dental conditions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Teeth Dataset," which includes images categorized into the following disease classes:

- CaS (Caries)
- CoS (Crown)
- Gum (Gum Diseases)
- MC (Mouth Cancers)
- OC (Oral Cancers)
- OLP (Oral Lichen Planus)
- OT (Other Types)

# Features
- Data Augmentation: Techniques used to increase the dataset size and variability.
- Model Architecture: Custom CNN architectures designed for classifying dental images.
- Fine Tuning: Transfer learning of MobileNet V2 and tuning it to be used in Teeth diseases classification.
- Evaluation: Metrics and methods used to evaluate model performance on training, validation, and test sets.
- Visualization: Tools for visualizing images and their classifications, including grid-based displays of example images.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- Scikit-learn
